# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Hardik Tater, a passionate and enthusiastic Data Scientist in training currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Data Science and Analytics at RA Podar College of Commerce and Economics (2022-2025). With a blend of technical expertise and a deep interest in solving complex real-world problems, I aim to leverage data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to create impactful solutions.

## üéì Educational Background & Learning Journey
My educational journey has been driven by a fascination for data-driven insights and the potential of machine learning to revolutionize industries. Through rigorous coursework, projects, and internships, I‚Äôve developed a strong foundation in:

Machine Learning (Supervised & Unsupervised Learning)
Deep Learning & Neural Networks
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Big Data Analytics and Statistics
I have completed various certifications, including:

Machine Learning Specialization from Stanford University
Python for Data Science from IBM
Cybersecurity from Cisco
Coding Interview Preparation from Meta
These experiences have equipped me with the skills and knowledge to tackle data challenges across industries, from finance to marketing and beyond.

## üíº Professional Experience
As a Data Science Intern at Tanmay Marketing, I worked on building models to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction. I collaborated closely with the team to apply my technical skills to sales analytics, customer segmentation, and predictive modeling, achieving measurable improvements in brand presence and decision-making processes.

In addition, I‚Äôve completed several personal and academic projects that have honed my skills in model evaluation, feature engineering, and data visualization.

## üîß Technical Skills & Tools
Here‚Äôs a quick snapshot of the technical tools and libraries I work with regularly:

- Programming Languages: Python, R, SQL, MATLAB, HTML, CSS
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, PyTorch
- Data Processing & Visualization: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Big Data & Cloud: Apache Spark, Hadoop
- Databases: MySQL, SQLite
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
I‚Äôm always learning and experimenting with new tools and frameworks to stay ahead in this fast-evolving field. I am particularly interested in working with Apache Spark and Hugging Face to expand my capabilities in big data processing and NLP.

## üìà Projects & Highlights
Here are a few standout projects from my portfolio:

- Nifty Stock Prediction Model: Developed a stock prediction model for the Nifty Mid Select Index, analyzing daily movements of 25 stocks, considering factors such as volume, delivery trades, and price changes. Leveraged yfinance, Scikit-learn, and backtesting to refine predictions.

- Gold Price Prediction: Built a time series forecasting model for predicting gold prices using various machine learning regressors. This project involved intensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization techniques.

- Interactive Chatbot with LangChain: Created a chatbot using LangChain and advanced NLP techniques to maintain contextual conversations. Integrated APIs like Arxiv, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo for real-time information retrieval and implemented enhanced user interfaces with IPython widgets.

- Fraud Detection Model: Worked on a financial fraud detection project with over 6 million rows of data, cleaning, feature engineering, and training several machine learning classifiers. This project provided insights into real-world applications of machine learning in financial risk management.

## üèÜ Achievements & Leadership
I believe in balancing technical acumen with leadership and teamwork. During my time in school and college, I served as:

Head Boy of my high school, leading over 1000 students and overseeing various academic and extracurricular activities.
Head of Department for the Moneta College Fest, India's largest financial fest, where I coordinated with multiple teams, managed events, and ensured smooth execution of the fest.
I also represented my college in inter-college kabaddi tournaments, honing my teamwork and strategic thinking abilities.

## üå± What‚Äôs Next?
I am currently exploring advanced topics like Reinforcement Learning, AutoML, and Explainable AI (XAI) to further deepen my knowledge in the field of machine learning and AI. My goal is to continuously improve my skills and contribute to open-source projects while building innovative solutions that have a tangible impact.
